All communication between separate applications should take place using sockets. You will need multiple
sockets to make this program work. You will be required to demonstrate your program working with two
separate slaves, one of type A and one of type B, and two separate clients.

In addition, you are going to need multiple threads in the applications. The master will require at least
one thread for each program with which it communicates. But remember that a thread that blocks waiting
for, for example, a job from the client, cannot simultaneously send a message to a client that a job has
completed. So to truly make your program robust you will probably want a separate thread for every
direction in which a message can be sent (i.e. a master thread that writes to a client, a separate master
thread that reads from the client, etc.). All communication between threads will use shared memory
objects with appropriate locking as discussed in the class lectures.

All steps should be displayed to the console so that it is possible to observe the system working correctly
by looking at the messages in each window. This includes the client receiving a job from the user, the
client submitting a job to the master, the master receiving a job from the client, the master assigning a
job to the slave, the slave receiving a job from the master, the slave completing a job, the slave informing
the master that the job is complete, the master receiving a message from the slave that the job is
complete, the master informing the client that the job is complete, and the client informing the user that
the job is complete.
